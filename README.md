# awesome-baremetal

Bare-metal is awesome. Let's share our favourite tools.

## Rules

* Ordered alphabetically (eventually consistent)
* Recent development or release (within the last 6 months) - or deemed relevant by curator
* No defunct or abandoned projects
* Must show signs of traction or corporate use
 * No "my scripts for my homelab that only I use" submissions.
 * This list is curated and not a museum, so the project should be active and relevant
* No advertisements
* Format: `link to GitHub or website - "quote from GitHub repo or website"`

Curator: [Alex Ellis](https://www.alexellis.io) - CNCF Ambassador, [OpenFaaS](https://openfaas.com/) & [Inlets](https://docs.inlets.dev/) Founder.

## Appendix

### Sorting sections

Each section should be sorted after it's been updated, here's how you can do that with bash.

```bash
cat | sort -f
# Copy / paste

# Control + D
```

Then paste the output back into the document.
