## Bare-metal cloud

Rent bare-metal from a cloud vendor on an hourly, monthly, or longer term commitment.

For a more comprehensive list see the actuated docs: [Provision a Server](https://docs.actuated.com/provision-server/). [Actuated](https://actuated.com) runs CI in ephemeral microVMs using Firecracker so requires bare-metal or nested virtualisation.

`x86_64` and / or arm64:

* [AlibabaCloud bare metal](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ebm) - `x86_64` & `arm64`
* [AWS Bare Metal](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/compute/amazon-ec2-bare-metal/)  - `x86_64` & `arm64`
* [Equinix Metal bare-metal infrastructure](https://metal.equinix.com/) - `x86_64` & `arm64` (End of Life)
* [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) - `x86_64` and `arm64` (Best value for money, Europe region only)

The Raspberry Pi 4B and 5 provide arm64 support with several operating systems like Ubuntu LTS being available. An NVMe can be plugged in over USB-C or PCIe, see also: [Upgrade your Raspberry Pi 4 with a NVMe boot drive](https://alexellisuk.medium.com/upgrade-your-raspberry-pi-4-with-a-nvme-boot-drive-d9ab4e8aa3c2) and [Booting the Raspberry Pi 5 from NVMe](https://blog.alexellis.io/booting-the-raspberry-pi-5-from-nvme/)

The Mac Mini M1 and Mac Mini M2 can be installed with [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org), which then provides one of the fastest CPU/storage options for a self-hosted local Arm64 Linux host.

### Sorting sections

Each section should be sorted after it's been updated, here's how you can do that with bash.

```bash
cat | sort --ignore-case
# Copy / paste

# Control + D
```

Then paste the output back into the document.
